# General_OR_Kiryana_Store_Management_System
This is my basic first year project on Basic Kiryana OR General Store Management System coded in C.
<br>
This repository contains a C-based General Store Management System that serves as a comprehensive tool for managing inventory, customers, discounts, and administrative functions. Developed by Me(M.Obaid), this system offers a user-friendly interface for both customers and administrators.
<br>
# Features:
Customer Management: New and existing customers can shop, view inventory, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.<br>
Inventory Management: Includes functions to display entire inventory, section-wise items, add/remove items from the inventory.<br>
Discount Management: Admins can set discounts for customers, manage existing discounts, and view customer-specific discount lists.<br>
Admin Panel: Provides access to various admin functionalities like managing inventory, customers, discounts, and changing admin credentials.<br>
# Usage:
For new customers, the system prompts for account creation, including name, phone number, and a secure PIN for authentication.<br>
Existing customers can log in using their registered phone numbers and PIN to shop seamlessly.<br>
This system ensures a secure and streamlined shopping experience for customers while granting administrative control over store operations. <br>
# Credits:
Integration Credits: Akhyar contributed to the some admin interface design integration.<br>
Feel free to explore and utilize this system for effective store management!
